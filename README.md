# Spectrum-Dreams
An interactive art installation that explores the neuroscience of dreams through physical interaction, simulating the transition into REM sleep and the generation of dream imagery.

## Concept Overview 

This project is a tangible representation of the dream generation process during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, based on the "Activation-Synthesis" hypothesis from neuroscience.

-   **Metaphor:** The act of rotating the clock pointer symbolizes the passage of time and the cyclical nature of sleep cycles.

-   **Visual Output:** The flowing LED lights represent the bottom-up PGO signals being synthesized by the brain into a dream narrative.

-   **Auditory Output:** The owl's sound signifies the emergence of a specific dream element from the unconscious.
